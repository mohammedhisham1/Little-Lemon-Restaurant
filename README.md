# Little-Lemon-Restaurant
The little lemon app is the capstone project for Meta's Back-End Developer Certificate on Coursera

little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally sourced menu with daily specials.

The restaurant is in the process of transition from a one-page website to a database driven web application using the Django framework. Currently, the pages for Home, About and Book are completed.
